# 🏥 Patient Readmission Prediction Model

This project builds a machine-learning model to predict the likelihood of a patient being readmitted to the hospital.  
The goal is to help healthcare teams identify high-risk patients early and improve patient outcomes while reducing hospital costs.

## 📌 Project Overview

Hospital readmissions are a major challenge for health systems.  
Using historical patient data, this project:

- Cleans and preprocesses clinical and demographic data  
- Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Builds a machine-learning model to predict readmission  
- Evaluates model performance using multiple metrics  
- Provides insights that can support clinical decision-making  

Dataset used: **Expanded_Patient_Readmission_Data.csv**
